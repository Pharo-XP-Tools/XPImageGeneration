When the program executes, the annotated AST nodes trigger its metalinks which executes additional behavior.\r\rAll-in-all, you can consider that an AST node corresponds to a particular expression in your source code. For example, if you install a metalink object on an instance variable of a class, the metalink will annotate all expressions referring to that instance variable in the source code of this class’ methods. The metalink object holds a set of AST nodes corresponding to these expressions, so that it knows where it is installed in the source code. \r\rDuring the metalink installation process, each time a metalink object annotates an AST node (_i.e._, an expression in the source code), this AST node is added to the set of nodes held by the metalink object.\r\r## The problem\rIn this task, we provide a test method  (`MetalinkStrangeNodeTest>>#testCollectionContents`, click on it) that installs a metalink object on an instance variable `instVar` of a class `ReflectivityExamples2`. \r\rThis instance variable is referenced in 4 expressions in the source code of the `ReflectivityExamples2` class. The developer of this test thought that after installation, the metalink’s set would hold 4 AST nodes, one for each source code expression referring to instVar. \r\rHowever, the test fails due to the metalink holding an incorrect number of nodes after installation: there is an extra node in the nodes set of the metalink. \r\rWe consider that the metalink installation process is correct: it is the test that is wrong.\r\r## Your task\rYour task is to understand why the test is not correctly testing the metalink installation process:.\rYou have to: \r* Understand the error in the test\r* Fix the test to make it pass\r* Explain why the number of nodes is incorrect, i.e., the reason why there is an extra node (where in the source code, and why). \r\rTo help you, we stored the set of nodes held by the metalink in an instance variable in the test.
